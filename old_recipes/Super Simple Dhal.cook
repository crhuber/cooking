>> Instructions

Put the lentils into a large saucepan along with 1.5 litres (6 cups) of water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer uncovered for 10â€“15 minutes until cooked. Skim off the foam as it gathers at the top.

Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and fry for 5 minutes.

Add the garlic, ginger and chillies to the pan along with the spices and fry for 2 minutes.

Add the tomatoes and fry for another 2 minutes.

Once the lentils are done, transfer the onion mixture to the saucepan of lentils and simmer for 10 minutes. If the dhal is too dry, add a splash more water. If it's too wet, continue cooking for a few more minutes.
6. To finish, stir the coriander into the dhal along with generous pinches of salt and pepper, then serve. Yum!
