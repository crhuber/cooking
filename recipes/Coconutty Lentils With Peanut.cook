Finely slice the Garlic Cloves. Roughly chop the coriander and then finely slice the green chili.

Heat 1 olive oil in a large #saucepan{} over a low-medium heat and fry the garlic for 3 mins, until lightly golden.

Add the Curry Paste and fry for 30 secs

Add in the cherry tomatoes, lentils, and around Â¾ of the tin of Coconut Milk. Bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer, cook for 10 mins. Stir through the Spinach.

In the meantime, bring a pot of water to a boil and carefully drop in the eggs. Cook for 6 min, then remove and drain under cold water. Once cool enough to handle, peel and set aside.

Add coriander and half of the chili to a food processor with peanuts, lemon juice, and reserved coconut milk. Blitz until smooth then season with salt and pepper.

Serve lentils in bowls topped with a drizzle of the peanut chutney, jammy egg, green chili, and more coriander, if you like.
