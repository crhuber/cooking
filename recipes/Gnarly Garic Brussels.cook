Trim the @brussel sprouts{10%oz}, discard any tatty outer leaves, then cut in half. Place cut-side down in a single layer in a large dry non-stick frying pan on a high heat, and char for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the garlic. Crush the @pistachios{1%oz} in a pestle and mortar. Halve the @pomegranate{1}, squeeze the juice of one half through a sieve into a bowl, then hold the other half cut-side down in your fingers and bash the back of it with a spoon so all the seeds tumble out. Stir the sliced @garlic{2%cloves} into the sprouts with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and a couple of splashes of water, then cook for 1 more minute.

Divide the @organic goat cheese{2%tbps} between your plates, spoon the gnarly sprouts on top, then sprinkle over the pomegranate seeds and pistachios. Drizzle over the pomegranate juice and 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, sprinkle with 
a pinch of sea salt and black pepper from a height, and serve. Delicious
